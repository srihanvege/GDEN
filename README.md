# 🧬 GDEN — GPCR Diffusion Enhanced Network

**GDEN** is a generative AI framework for **target-conditioned molecular design**, focused on creating **bivalent antagonists** for **Class A GPCRs** (G protein–coupled receptors).  
The project combines **attention-based protein encoding**, **diffusion-based molecular generation**, and **reinforcement-guided optimization** to design new drug-like compounds tailored to specific GPCR pockets — such as the **β₂-adrenergic receptor (B2AR)**.

## 🚀 Overview

**Goal:**  
To generate *target-specific* drug candidates by conditioning a molecular diffusion model on deep protein embeddings derived from **GPCRdb** sequence and structure data.

**Architecture Summary:**

| Stage | Description |
|:------|:-------------|
| 🧠 **Protein Encoder** | Uses transformer or GNN attention layers (ESM, GAT, or GVP) to create embeddings of Class A GPCR binding pockets. |
| 💊 **Molecule Generator** | A conditional diffusion model (plus optional autoregressive transformer) generates molecular graphs or SELFIES strings conditioned on the target pocket embedding. |
| 🔗 **Bivalent Constraints** | Generates two pharmacophore “warheads” and a linker satisfying geometric constraints predicted from the receptor structure. |
| 🧪 **Evaluation Loop** | Filters generated compounds using drug-likeness (Lipinski, QED, SA) and QSAR property predictors; validates with docking scores (GNINA/Vina). |
| 🎯 **RL Fine-Tuning** | Reinforces models using PPO/RLHF with composite rewards (affinity, selectivity, drug-likeness). |
